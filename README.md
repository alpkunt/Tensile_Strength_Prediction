# Tensile Strength Prediction
With this app, any user can predict tensile strength of stell specimens according to their chemical compositions by using Machine Learning Models.

# TODO:
  - Chosing best ML model to predict tensile strength of steel. (Done - 22.06.2022)
  - Creating a FASTAPI backend for serving ML model to public user (Target is Material Scientists and Metallurgical Engineers) 23.06.2022 -->
  - Creating a frontend to ease prediction process.
  - Creating a pool for other engineers to add new compositions and data for incresed accuracy of model.
  - Detecting data shift and categorising possible linkage between compositon of elements.
